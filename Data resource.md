###Introduction

The data for this assignment come from the Hospital Compare web site (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov)
run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The purpose of the web site is to provide data and
information about the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certied hospitals in the U.S. This dataset es-
sentially covers all major U.S. hospitals.

The Hospital Compare web site contains a lot of data and we will only look at a small subset for this
assignment. The zip le for this assignment contains three les
•
outcome-of-care-measures.csv
: Contains information about 30-day mortality and readmission rates
for heart attacks, heart failure, and pneumonia for over 4,000 hospitals.
•
hospital-data.csv
: Contains information about each hospital.
•
Hospital_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf
: Descriptions of the variables in each le (i.e the code book).
