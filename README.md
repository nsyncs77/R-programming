### Finding the best hospital in a state

Write a function called best that take two arguments: the 2-character abbreviated name of a state and an outcome name. 
The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv and returns a character vector with the name of the hospital that has the best (i.e. lowest) 30-day mortality for the specied outcome in that state.
